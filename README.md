# CS-Playground-React Share-Link API
This app is a simple Node/Express API which enables sharing code with [CS-Playground-React](https://github.com/no-stack-dub-sack/cs-playground-react). It connects to a MongoDB backend using Mongoose and has two simple routes: `/insertCode`, and `/getCode`, which serve self explanatory purposes. When a user generates a share-link, a `POST` request is made to the `/insertCode` route, and the code in the editor is saved to MongoDB and the MongoID for the entry is returned. The id is used to construct the share link, which is extracted from the URL when a user follows the link. Using the extracted MongoID, a `GET` request is made to the `/getCode` route, and the code is retrieved and populated as the app's current editor state. Only requests generated from `https://cs-playground-react.surge.sh` are valid.
